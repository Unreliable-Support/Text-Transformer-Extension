# Text Transformer Chrome Extension

A lightweight and easy-to-use Chrome extension that adds powerful text transformation capabilities to your browser's context menu. Stop manually re-typing text to fix capitalizationâ€”simply select any text, right-click, and choose the format you need.

This tool is perfect for writers, developers, students, and anyone who works with text on the web. It works seamlessly in text editors like `<textarea>` and `<input>` fields, as well as on any selectable text on a webpage.

## Features

-   **Seamless Context Menu Integration**: Access transformations with a simple right-click on any selected text.
-   **Multiple Transformation Cases**:
    -   **Uppercase All**: Converts the entire selected text to UPPERCASE.
    -   **Sentence Case**: Capitalizes the first letter of each sentence and converts the rest to lowercase.
    -   **Title Case**: Intelligently capitalizes the main words in a title, keeping small words like "a," "an," "the," and "in" lowercase.
-   **Works Everywhere**:
    -   **In Text Fields**: Directly modifies text within `<textarea>` and `<input>` elements without losing focus.
    -   **On Any Webpage**: Transforms static text selected in paragraphs, headings, or other elements.
-   **Lightweight & Secure**: No external libraries and minimal permissions required (`contextMenus`, `activeTab`).
